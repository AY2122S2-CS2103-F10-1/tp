TAddressBook (TAB) is a **desktop app made for CS2030S Lab Teaching Assistants (TA) to keep track of students Lab assignments, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

If you can type fast, TAB can get your Lab management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.
