### Project: TAddressBook

TAddress Book is a desktop app for CS2030S TAs to manage students and labs, optimized for use via a Command Line
Interface. It is based on [AddressBook Level 3](https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3/).

Given below are my contributions to the project.

**Features**
1. Implemented ability to store marks associated with individual labs for individual students.
    * Allows TA to keep track of marks given when grading labs.
2. Implemented commands to allow for submission of labs, grading of labs and editing of lab details (status and/or marks).
    * Allows TA to keep track of students' progress in labs as well as his/her own grading progress.
