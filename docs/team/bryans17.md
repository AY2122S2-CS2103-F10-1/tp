### Project: TAddressBook

**TAddressBook** is a student project based on [AddressBook Level 3](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3). It is a desktop application created with the aim of helping CS2030S Teaching Assistants (TAs) keep track of student's lab assignments.

Given below are my contributions to the project.
- **New Feature:** Add Lab
  - What it does: 
    - Adds a new `Lab` with an Integer `labNumber` between 0 and 20 inclusive and default `LabStatus` of `UNSUBMITTED`, to the `MasterLabList` as well as to all `Student`s in the list.
    - The Ui automatically updates to show the newly added `Lab`.
